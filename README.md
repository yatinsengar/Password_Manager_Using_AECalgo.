# Password_Manager_Using_AECalgo.
I create a password manager using HTML, CSS, JS, and MySQL. It is written with the most secure algorithms in the market. 

The idea is just like any other password manager available out there - Take a MASTER PASSWORD from the user that is not stored by the program. 
This master password is then used to generate a cryptographically strong key that is then used to encrypt/decrypt all your other passwords with a military grade algorithm called the AES-256. 

It is a command line application that first uses the PBKDF2 (Password Based Key Derivation Function) to compute a Master Key from the Master Password chosen by the user and a Device Secret that is randomly generated by the program. 
The Master Key which is of 256 bit length is then used to encrypt/decrypt all the stuff inside.
